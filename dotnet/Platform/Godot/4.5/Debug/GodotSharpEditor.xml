            <summary>
            <para><see cref="T:Godot.EditorUndoRedoManager"/> is a manager for <see cref="T:Godot.UndoRedo"/> objects associated with edited scenes. Each scene has its own undo history and <see cref="T:Godot.EditorUndoRedoManager"/> ensures that each action performed in the editor gets associated with a proper scene. For actions not related to scenes (<see cref="T:Godot.ProjectSettings"/> edits, external resources, etc.), a separate global history is used.</para>
            <para>The usage is mostly the same as <see cref="T:Godot.UndoRedo"/>. You create and commit actions and the manager automatically decides under-the-hood what scenes it belongs to. The scene is deduced based on the first operation in an action, using the object from the operation. The rules are as follows:</para>
            <para>- If the object is a <see cref="T:Godot.Node"/>, use the currently edited scene;</para>
            <para>- If the object is a built-in resource, use the scene from its path;</para>
            <para>- If the object is external resource or anything else, use global history.</para>
            <para>This guessing can sometimes yield false results, so you can provide a custom context object when creating an action.</para>
            <para><see cref="T:Godot.EditorUndoRedoManager"/> is intended to be used by Godot editor plugins. You can obtain it using <see cref="M:Godot.EditorPlugin.GetUndoRedo"/>. For non-editor uses or plugins that don't need to integrate with the editor's undo history, use <see cref="T:Godot.UndoRedo"/> instead.</para>
            <para>The manager's API is mostly the same as in <see cref="T:Godot.UndoRedo"/>, so you can refer to its documentation for more examples. The main difference is that <see cref="T:Godot.EditorUndoRedoManager"/> uses object + method name for actions, instead of <see cref="T:Godot.Callable"/>.</para>

            <summary>
            <para>This is the control that implements property editing in the editor's Settings dialogs, the Inspector dock, etc. To get the <see cref="T:Godot.EditorInspector"/> used in the editor's Inspector dock, use <see cref="M:Godot.EditorInterface.GetInspector"/>.</para>
            <para><see cref="T:Godot.EditorInspector"/> will show properties in the same order as the array returned by <see cref="M:Godot.GodotObject.GetPropertyList"/>.</para>
            <para>If a property's name is path-like (i.e. if it contains forward slashes), <see cref="T:Godot.EditorInspector"/> will create nested sections for "directories" along the path. For example, if a property is named <c>highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color</c>, it will be shown as "Node Path Color" inside the "GDScript" section nested inside the "Highlighting" section.</para>
            <para>If a property has <see cref="F:Godot.PropertyUsageFlags.Group"/> usage, it will group subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new group starts. An empty group name effectively ends the current group. <see cref="T:Godot.EditorInspector"/> will create a top-level section for each group. For example, if a property with group usage is named <c>Collide With</c> and its hint string is <c>collide_with_</c>, a subsequent <c>collide_with_area</c> property will be shown as "Area" inside the "Collide With" section. There is also a special case: when the hint string contains the name of a property, that property is grouped too. This is mainly to help grouping properties like <c>font</c>, <c>font_color</c> and <c>font_size</c> (using the hint string <c>font_</c>).</para>
            <para>If a property has <see cref="F:Godot.PropertyUsageFlags.Subgroup"/> usage, a subgroup will be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be created for each subgroup.</para>
            <para><b>Note:</b> Unlike sections created from path-like property names, <see cref="T:Godot.EditorInspector"/> won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.</para>
